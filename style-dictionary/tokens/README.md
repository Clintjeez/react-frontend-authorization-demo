# Style Dictionary

A Style Dictionary uses design tokens to define styles once and use those styles on any platform or language. It provides a single place to create and edit your styles, and exports these tokens to all the places you need - iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML, sketch files, style documentation, etc.

## How to Run the Style-Dictionary

`npm run build-tokens` or `node ./style-dictionary/index.js`

## How to Contribute

If you want to contribute then create a JSON file under the `style-dictionary/tokens` location and then run `npm run build-tokens` or `node ./style-dictionary/index.js` command from the the terminal.
